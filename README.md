# PhotoClub Mobile
PhotoClub is a crossplatform application for sharing photos, especially during events. In it, a user will sign up and create an album, and then all attendes can join it (without signing in).

## Making it Crossplatform
Instead of using ReactNative or Flutter, we decided to make it native on both iOS and Android. To achieve this, we used [skip.tools](https://skip.tools) to write an iOS app and **transpile** it for android. Thus, making it native on both iOS and Android with (a bit more than) half the time.
